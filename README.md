# To-Do List & Notes App

This application helps users organize tasks, jot down notes, and manage their goals efficiently. With a clean and intuitive interface, users can create, update, and delete task lists, attach notes, and set reminders for important deadlines. Designed to support productivity, this app makes it easier to stay focused, improve time management, and retain important ideas.

Task data is saved locally on the device using the `sqflite` Flutter package, allowing for smooth offline functionality through SQL-based queries.
